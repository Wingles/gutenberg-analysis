# Standardized Project Gutenberg Corpus Tutorial
This repository contains some example notebooks that illustrate how to use the Standardized Project Gutenberg Corpus (SPGC) and reproduce the analysis presented in the manuscript

[A standardized Project Gutenberg corpus for statistical analysis of natural language and quantitative linguistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08092)  
M. Gerlach, F. Font-Clos, arXiv:1812.08092, Dec 2018

The data is not included in this repository, but you can easily get in in two ways:
1. Run the [code](https://github.com/pgcorpus/gutenberg) yourself to get the latest version of the corpus, which will include all books in PG as of today.
2. Download the [pre-processed data](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2422560) to get exactly the same books we used in the manuscript (those available up to July 18, 2018)
